AdBlock filter that cleans websites by removing premium content ads, privacy policies, and other unnecessary elements, providing users with a streamlined and clutter-free browsing experience. Simple, efficient, and effective

**New!** Blocks ugly fake/unofficial websites with ads and trackers

# Work in progress
CutClut still doesn't cover most websites. You can [create a *site request* issue](https://github.com/DestroyerBDT/CutClut/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Site+request&projects=&template=site-request.md&title=) to request more websites.
 Websites with front-ends that remove all the clutter won't be accepted but you can request the front-end websites.
