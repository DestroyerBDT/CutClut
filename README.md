AdBlock filter that cleans websites by removing premium content ads, privacy policies, and other unnecessary elements, providing users with a streamlined and clutter-free browsing experience. Simple, efficient, and effective

**New!** Blocks ugly fake/unofficial websites with ADs and trackers

# Work in progress
CutClut still doesn't cover most websites. You can [create a *site request* issue](https://github.com/DestroyerBDT/CutClut/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Site+request&projects=&template=site-request.md&title=) to request more websites.
 [Websites with front-ends](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends) that remove all the clutter will not be accepted, but you can request the [front-end websites](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends).
