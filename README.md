  - Privacy policies
  - Donations

# Important information

## Some websites will never be added
[Websites with front-ends](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends) that remove all the clutter will not be accepted, but you can request the [front-end websites](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends)
### Exceptions
- The front-end doesn't have some functionality (*for the end-user*) present in the original website
- The front-end is uglier than the original website
## Work in progress
CutClut currently covers very few websites.
You can [create a *site request* issue](https://github.com/DestroyerBDT/CutClut/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Site+request&projects=&template=site-request.md&title=) to request more websites!
